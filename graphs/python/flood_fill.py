    """
    Simulate the flood fill algorithm used in graphic applications
    like MS-Paint. Given a 2D screen represented by an MxN array
    where each number represents a different color, a start pixel,
    and a new color, replace the color of the given pixel and all
    adjacent same colored pixels with the new color.

    For example, on a screen with the following configuration, and
    start pixel (0, 1) and new color 3, the screen should change as follows:

    Initial Screen:
    [
      [1, 1, 0],
      [1, 2, 1],
      [0, 1, 1]
    ]
    Resulting Screen:
    [
      [3, 3, 0],
      [3, 2, 1],
      [0, 1, 1]
    ]
