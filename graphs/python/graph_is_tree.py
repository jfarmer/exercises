    Given a directed graph, determine whether it's a tree or not.
    A directed graph is a tree if the following two conditions hold:

    1. There's exactly one vertex from which every other vertex is reachable
    2. No vertex is reachable in two different ways, i.e., via two different
       paths

    There are other conditions that can be used to determine whether a graph
    is a tree. You're free to look those up and try to make use of them, too.
