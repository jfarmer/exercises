    Given a graph G, represented as an adjacency list, return its
    line graph Line(G).

    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph

    To form the line graph, we turn edges into vertexes and vice versa.
    Every edge in G becomes a vertex in Line(G).

    If e1 and e2 are edges in G then there's an edge (e1, e2) in Line(G)
    if e1 and e2 share a vertex in the original graph.
