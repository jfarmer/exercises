def graph_longest_path(graph, start_node, end_node):
    """
    Given a graph and two vertexes (called start and end), find the
    longest path from start_node to end_node. Return something appropriate
    if there's no such path.

    Note: This is typically a harder problem than finding the shortest path,
    as it can't be solved with a simple BFS approach.
