def graph_transpose(graph):
    """
    Given a directed graph, represented as an adjacency list, return its
    graph transpose (aka opposite graph). This graph is formed by reversing
    the direction of all the edges.

    That is, if there is an edge "A -> B" in the original graph then there
    should be an edge "B -> A" in the opposite graph.

    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose_graph
