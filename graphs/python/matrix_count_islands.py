def matrix_count_islands(matrix):
    """
    Given a 2D binary matrix, find the number of islands. An island is
    surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
    horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the matrix
    are surrounded by water.

    For example, the matrix below contains 4 islands:
    [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    ]
